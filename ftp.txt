A cipher suite is a collection of cryptographic algorithms that are used to encrypt and decrypt data exchanged between a client and a server. 

Client cipler suites ie which all suits are with the clien t  
Which suit server used 
 

Encrypted data which the server sends can be  viewed only using the  Encryption key. 

Location of the connection.

NMAP
1)	Sudo apt-get install nmap
2)	Nmap www.geeksforgeeks.com
3)	nmap -v geeksforgeeks.org
4)	nmap 103.76.228.* for entire subnet 
5)	sudo nmap -sA 103.76.228.244
Detecting firewall settings can be useful during penetration testing and vulnerability scans. To detect it we use “-sA” option. This will provide you with information about the firewall being active on the host. It uses an ACK scan to receive the information.

6)	sudo nmap -sL 172.217.174.238
We use “sL” option to find hostnames for the given host by completing a DNS query for each one.

7)	Nmap -h for getting all commands in nmap.

8)	Nmap -sS www.google.com - can be accessed by root privileges. 
Here -sS flag is used for TCP SYN Scan, Which is a stealthy and efficient method of scanning for open ports on a target system.

9)	Nmap -sU www.google.com - . The “-sU” flag is used with nmap to perform a UDP scan, which allows the user to discover open UDP ports and services on a target system.

10)	 nmap -sn www.geeksforgeeks.com
The “-sn” flag is used with nmap to perform a ping scan, which sends ICMP requests to a target host or network to determine hosts is up or not.

11)	The “-p” flag is used with nmap to perform scan on a specific port or range of ports. ( In our case it will scan port 80,443 and 21 )
nmap -p 80 443 21 <Domain Name>

12)	nmap -p 1-80 <Domain Name> - to get from a range of ports 

13)	 Here -A indicates aggressive, it will give us extra information, like OS detection (-O), version detection, script scanning (-sC), and traceroute (–traceroute). It even provides a lot of valuable information about the host.
nmap -A <Domain Name>

14)	Nmap --trace out google.com-root access 



Exp 2
1)	ping google.com (Used to test the reachability of a host and measure the round-trip time for messages sent from the originating host to a destination computer.)
2)	traceroute google.com (Traces the route that packets take to a network host.)
3)	nslookup google.com (Queries Internet domain name servers to find IP addresses associated with a domain name.)
-	The nbstat command is specific to the Windows operating system and is used for troubleshooting NetBIOS name resolution.
-	In Linux, the equivalent command for troubleshooting network issues and name resolution is nslookup, which stands for Name Server Lookup. It serves as a network administration tool used to query the Domain Name System (DNS) for obtaining domain name-to-IP address mappings or other specific DNS records, making it valuable for troubleshooting DNS-related issues.
-	
4)	netstat -tuln (Displays network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships.)
●	To list all tcp ports netstat -at
●	Udp - netstat -au
●	Listening ports -l (tcp -lt, udp - lu)
●	Static prots -s (“ “  “ “  “ )
5)	Ipconfig - is used for displaying details of our network configuration and refreshing the DNS and DHCP settings. The ipconfig command by default shows our IP address, default gateway, and subnet mask but we can get several details using this command with correct parameters.
6)	Hostname - A hostname is a name given to a computer and attached to the network. Its main purpose is to uniquely identify over a network.


7)	arp -a (Displays and modifies the IP-to-Physical address translation tables used by the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP))

 arp -a
? (10.0.2.3) at 52:55:0a:00:02:03 [ether] on enp0s3
? (10.0.2.2) at 52:55:0a:00:02:02 [ether] on enp0s3
The arp -a command shows the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache on your system, listing IP addresses and their corresponding MAC addresses, which are associated with the network interface.
Here's what each part means:
●	? - Placeholder for the hostname (if not resolved).
●	(10.0.2.3) and (10.0.2.2) - IP addresses on your local network.
●	52:55:0a:00:02:03 and 52:55:0a:00:02:02 - MAC addresses associated with those IP addresses.
●	[ether] - Type of physical layer, here indicating Ethernet.


8)	rarp -a (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol, used to request an IP address from a gateway server based on the MAC address. Often replaced by DHCP.)
9)	Pingpath google.com 
pingpath combines functionality similar to both ping and traceroute. It attempts to ping a remote host while also identifying the path (network route) the packets take to reach the target. Essentially, it provides both reachability and routing information, 

ip add show (To show IP addresses:)
ip route show (To display routing table:)
ifconfig (Configures network interfaces.)
ifconfig eth0 up 
dig google.com (DNS lookup utility, provides more detailed information than `nslookup`.)
route -n (To display the routing table:)
